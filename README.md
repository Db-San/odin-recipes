# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a basic recipe website created as part of The Odin Project's [Foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) curriculum. The website features a collection of delicious recipes for users to browse through and try out in their own kitchens.

The website isn't very pretty, yet. Not unless youâ€™re into [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/), that is.

Most importantly, the main purpose of this is to hone my HTML chops; eventually in the future, it will be styled up with CSS.

## Website
