<!-- h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body. -->

<!-- Back in the index.html file, add a 
    link to the recipe page you just 
    created. Example: Under the 
    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, 
    write out the link like so: 
    <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. 
    The text of the link should again be the recipe name. 
-->

<!--
    Your new recipe page should
    have the following content:

    An image of the finished dish
    under the h1 heading that you
    added earlier. 
    
    You can find images of the dish
    on Google or the recipe site we
    linked to earlier.

    Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

    Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
    Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. 
    
    Bonus: consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.
