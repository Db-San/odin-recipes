<!-- h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body. -->

<!-- Back in the index.html file, add a 
    link to the recipe page you just 
    created. Example: Under the 
    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, 
    write out the link like so: 
    <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. 
    The text of the link should again be the recipe name. 
-->

<!--
    Your new recipe page should
    have the following content:

    An image of the finished dish
    under the h1 heading that you
    added earlier. 
    
    You can find images of the dish
    on Google or the recipe site we
    linked to earlier.
